## GUIDE:
To finish the game you have complete two main objectives, restart the cryostasis capsule and go back to sleep.

To restart the cryostasis capsule you have to use the panel located in the control room, but the door of this room is locked via code.

To get the code you have to find a USB located inside a bag, and the bag is in the captain's room.

Once you have the USB you have to go to the laboratory and use the USB in the computer to be able to see the code of the door.

Keep in mind that you just wake up from a long sleep, wich means that you have to find something to eat and drink before is too late.

You can find food in the dining room and water in your room.

Also when you restart the cryocapsule an alien appears in the cryostasys chamber, and you have to kill it or it won't let you get back to sleep.

To kill the alien you have to shoot him with a pistol, that you can get in yout crewmate's room.
